# Getty's Flowers 
**Getty's Flowers** is a web application that showcases a small portion of the Getty Museum's [Open Content Collection](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/search?open_content=true) in an interactive and visually fun way, inspired by Team Lab's [Story of the Forest](https://www.teamlab.art/w/story-of-the-forest/) exhibit. Each flower represents its respective artwork, and clicking the flower allows users to learn more about the artwork.
