        "description": "This page from a tulpenboek - an album of painted portraits of tulips - depicts two tulips on the recto and a third on the verso. The artist used layers of watercolor to emulate the shape and pattern of individual petals and closely cropped individual flowers in order to emphasize their unique character. Each bloom is identified by its name, which, following the Pre-Linnaean Dutch convention, can refer to their color, beauty, and cultivator. On the recto, the two tulips, the “Admirael Secretaris” and “Secretaris” are of a similar red and white variety. The additional designation of 'admirael' suggests that the bloom on the left, with its longer petals and soft curve is more exceptional than the flower to the right. On the verso is the Witte Marvelje, whose pointed petals and striations of red likely inspired its name, which means 'little white marvel'.",

        "description": "Dutch artists invented the flower piece, a type of painting that remained popular throughout the 1700s and 1800s, primarily in France. Artists used flower paintings as vehicles for brilliant color and animated composition, usually displaying an intense realism. Jan van Huysum was one of the most exuberant practitioners of the genre. Working in the 1700s, Van Huysum acquired the sophisticated taste and love of embellishment associated with the Rococo period in France. While flower pictures often carried moral messages, this picture and its probable companion also made by a follower of Van Huysum, Vase of Flowers, were conceived without didactic lessons for the viewer.",

Rendering meticulous detail, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder conveyed the silky texture of the petals, the prickliness of the rose thorns, and the fragility of opening buds. Insects crawl, alight, or perch on the bouquet. Each is carefully described and observed, from the dragonfly's transparent wings to the butterfly's minutely painted antennae. Although a vague reference, insects, short-lived like flowers, are a reminder of the brevity of life and the transience of its beauty. \nA rising interest in botany and a passion for flowers led to an increase in painted floral still lifes at the end of the 1500s in both the Netherlands and Germany. Bosschaert was the first great Dutch specialist in fruit and flower painting and the head of a family of artists. He established a tradition that influenced an entire generation of fruit and flower painters in the Netherlands.",

Following the Pre-Linnaean Dutch naming convention, each flower is identified by an inscription with their names deriving from colors, patterning, and individual cultivators. The name for the left most flower, the Vroech gevlamt branson kaer, describes its appearance and its early bloom. Bransons are red tulips with a yellow band, while 'gevlamt' describes the flicker of red that reaches from the base to the tip of the petal. Similarly, at the branson's right, the Admiral van Engelant (English Admiral), references its red and white colors and possible origins in England. On the right page, the Swimende Jan gerritsz, refers to the specific cultivator of the striking yellow tulip with white tips streaked with red. Its neighbor, the Gemarmert van kaer, is named for its marbleized red and white pattern.",

Though an outstanding example of a highly finished drawing, it was made as a study for the painting, The Madonna of the Rose Garden of 1473, in the Dominican church in Colmar.\nDuring the late 1400s, people began to perceive the natural world in a radically different way. They ventured out into nature to study it and record it firsthand. Along with others artists, Schongauer became one of the leading pioneers of an effort to make studies directly from nature.",

Hoefnagel echoed the curling lines of Bocskay's script with the petals of the flower known as a Maltese cross. Hoefnagel's most audacious response to Bocskay appears in the center of the page. To preserve Bocskay's calligraphic flourish, Hoefnagel painted the flower so as to suggest that the stem pierced the page. The illuminator, who can create an illusion of three-dimensionality, asserted the virtuosity of his art in contrast to that of the calligrapher, whose lines never disturb the two-dimensionality of the page. \nHoefnagel painted his objects with a microscopic detail that invites the viewer to look closely at these rare and exotic items, but his illustrations were not always strictly accurate.

        "description": "In the late 1400s, northern European artists began to study and draw plants and animals with a greater interest in accuracy. Although showing the uniqueness of each of these specimens was undoubtedly important to Hans Hoffmann, he equally tried to portray the individual beauty of each flower and insect. He placed the peony, two species of irises, an amaryllis, a may beetle, and a june bug in an attractive arrangement on the page. He drew the delicate forms carefully and added lush color in a palette of green, blue, and red. He used plain black chalk to represent the shadow cast by the beetle's body, illusionistically raising the beetle's legs off the ground with this trompe-l'oeil effect. \nHoffmann may have intended this arrangement of nature studies to be hung as a painting, since it was listed as such in the archives of its original owner and it remained in a frame until well into the 1800s. Scholars consider this one of the first examples of still life painting.",

        "description": "The round vase is of baluster form, having a short straight neck and swollen body that tapers down to a base roughly the same circumference as the opening at the top. It has a low domed lid pierced with five round holes. The body of the vase and top of the lid are each encircled by a single flowering branch molded in high relief with many sections in three dimensions. A limited palette of blue, green, turquoise, iron red, and black enamels has been used to color the branches, an irregular design of drapery swags and tassel ropes around part of the shoulder, and an asymmetrical pattern of small five-petaled flower heads near the base. Thin double red lines are painted around the outer rim of the lid and the neck and base of the vase.",

        "artistUrl": [""], 
        "date": "225-175 B.C.",
        "description": "Eros pendant earring fashioned from more than a hundred components. Construction was organized into three segments: bull's head, rosette, and Eros pendant, connected and stabilized by a hoop formed from gold wire. The bull's head at the top is constructed from two repoussé halves attached at their lower edge to a collar decorated with beaded and block-twisted wire. Beneath this collar is set a pearl, itself supported from below by a similarly decorated collar. The pendant figure of a fluttering winged Eros was formed by soldering two sheet-gold halves together. With granulated bandoliers and golden cloaks draping behind, the pudgy figure hold ritual offering plates in one hand and upraised torches in the other. Every element has been individually soldered onto the figures. The Eros is suspended from a gold rosette disk consisting of rings of decorative wires (strip twisted and block twisted) with the central flower formed by gold sheet cut into individual petals.",
